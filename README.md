Mine Sweeper is a classic game where you click on a square and use the revealed numbers to predict where you think there is a bomb hiding.  

Right clicking a square will flag the square and identify it as a mine.  Left clicking will reveal what is underneath whether it is a number a bomb or a blank space.  The first click is always a gamble but usually after that you will be able to tell with careful thought where the bombs are for the most part.

This game was built using React and an API on Heroku.  It's still being improved and having features added, and it's main purpose for existing was to teach me things about API's and how to design the UI.

Difficulty:  Difficulty up  will fetch a new game with the difficulty increased by one, up to a maximum level of 2.  Difficulty down button will decrease the difficulty by one and fetch a new game with the lowest setting of 0. 

On expert level games you can push CNTRL -  to zoom out and make room for the boxes on your screen depending on your screen size and how difficulty the game is.  I found that on expert it was hard to see all of the squares and this tip helped me.

Enjoy playing!
